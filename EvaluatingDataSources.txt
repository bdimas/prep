The data was collected on Christmas Eve, making it an exceptional circumstance. 
Another exceptional circumstance, unless you're specifically analyzing what happens after a large scale trauma such as 9/11 in a city where the events took place vs. a city where they did not. 
Just looking at the data shows that the age range is 18-21, with few exceptions. It looks as if this was collected by students on a campus, among fellow students and their friends (which would explain the people who aren't students). From what I understand from my psych background, quite a bit of data has this fallacy, because a lot of research is conducted on campuses by professors and their research assistants, who are generally students.
